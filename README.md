# CIPHERBYTE TECHNOLOGIES INTERNSHIP

<b> This  a 4 week virtual internship by CipherByte Technologies where the given tasks are performed as a proof of work for the interhsip. The chosen domain for the internship is Python Programming.
The following tasks are as follows:
- MasterMind Game
- Creating a Payment Receipt
- Recording my voice

  ## MASTERMIND GAME:
  <b> Two players play the game against each other; let’s assume Player 1 and Player 2.
      Player 1 plays first by setting a multi-digit number.
      Player 2 now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.
      If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got 
      correct.
      The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.
      Now, Player 2 gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.
      If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.
      If not, then Player 2 wins the game.

  ## CREATING A PAYMENT RECEIPT:
  <b> Creating payment receipts is a pretty common task, be it an e-commerce website or any local store for that matter.
      Here, you have to create our own transaction receipts just by using python. We would be using reportlab to generate the PDFs. Generally, it comes as a built-in package but sometimes it might not be present 
      too. If it’s not present, then simply type the following in your terminal

  ## RECORD YOUR VOICE:
  <b> Python can be used to perform a variety of tasks. One of them is creating a voice recorder. We can use python’s sounddevice module to record and play audio. This module along with the wavio or the scipy 
      module provides a way to save recorded audio.
